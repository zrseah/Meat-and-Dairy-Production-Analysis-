# World Meat & Dairy Production (1961 - 2022)

## Introduction

The increasing consumption of meat and dairy, driven by population growth and technological advancements, poses sustainability challenges due to limited supply and environmental impacts. Notably, animal agriculture is responsible for approximately 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, significantly contributing to the phenomenon of global warming.

## Key Findings
- Total meat production from 1961 to 2022 reached nearly 12.3 billion tonnes, reflecting a remarkable 403.5% growth since 1961.
- The top 5 countries in meat production historically are China, the United States (US), Brazil, the USSR, and Germany.
- Despite the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, it remains one of the top 5 meat producers overall, among 209 countries analyzed.
- China accounts for 41.44% (2.5 billion tonnes) of the total meat production among the top 5 countries.
- The US held the highest meat production per year from 1961 to 1990, with China taking the lead from 1991 to 2022.
- Both China and the US demonstrate a general increasing trend in meat production over the 62-year period.
- China exhibits the most volatile trend in meat production from 1961 to 2022, experiencing a sharp increase from 1977 to 1995, with a 441% rise. There were noticeable dips in meat production between 1995 and 1996 and again between 2018 and 2019.

## Background Research
During its existence from 1922 to 1991, the USSR was the largest transcontinental country globally, boasting a reported population of 290 million in 1990. Its vast landmass enabled extensive farming and agriculture, prioritized through policies and technological advancements. As a result, despite its dissolution, the USSR remains one of the top 5 meat producers historically.

Both the United States and China stand as the world's most populous countries. As of 2022, the US population stands at 333.3 million, while China's population reaches 1.412 billion. Surprisingly, despite China's threefold greater population compared to the US, its meat production was lower between 1961 and 1990. This discrepancy can be attributed partly to historical events such as the Great Leap Forward, a five-year industrialization plan initiated in China that shifted the focus from agriculture to industry. However, this transition resulted in the Great Chinese Famine, causing an estimated 56 million deaths.

China's agricultural technology and farming techniques initially lagged behind those of the US due to its early economic development stage. However, Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978 transitioned China from a planned economy and Maoist ideologies to an open economy, propelling it into one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Consequently, meat production surged between 1977 and 1995, surpassing the US in 1991.
The drop in meat production from 2018 to 2019 resulted from the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in 2018. ASF, a highly contagious viral disease affecting pigs, led to a massive culling of infected pigs in China, significantly reducing meat production during this period.

## Recommendation and Conclusion
To foster a sustainable environment for future generations, it is imperative that everyone plays a role in prioritizing the well-being of our planet. Addressing global warming requires collaborative efforts from nations worldwide. Superpowers should further explore policies and technologies aimed at mitigating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming while seeking sustainable solutions to meet the escalating demands of a growing population.
